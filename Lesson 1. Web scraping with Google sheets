/** 
**Lesson 1.** Hi! Here is an AppScript code that you can use to access Google Sheets, review the list of links to Cloud Skills Boost public profiles, review each profile, and calculate the number of badges.
Lesson 1
**The task.**
You should review an appscript code below. The app should do the following. It should access Google sheets. Review the list of links which lead to open cloudskillsboost public profiles. Review each profile and calculate number of badges. Here is an example of a cloudskillsboost public profile. https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/85a2f4b6-ce2a-4a67-a362-675c4a366772. Here is an example of a badge https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/85a2f4b6-ce2a-4a67-a362-675c4a366772/badges/4776948

Please consider the code below and review if it's launchable. You can fork this code or alternatively you can create your own code. Regards, Askar  */


JavaScript
/** @OnlyCurrentDoc */
function calculateBadges() {
  // Get the spreadsheet
  var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName("Links");

  // Get the list of links
  var links = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();

  // Iterate through the list of links
  for (var i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
    var link = links[i][0];

    // Get the profile data
    var profileData = UrlFetchApp.fetch(link).getContentText();

    // Parse the profile data to get the number of badges
    var numberOfBadges = parseProfileData(profileData);

    // Write the number of badges to the spreadsheet
    sheet.getRange(i + 2, 2).setValue(numberOfBadges);
  }
}

function parseProfileData(profileData) {
  // Parse the profile data to get the number of badges
  var badges = profileData.match(/"badges":\[(.*?)}\]/);
  if (badges && badges.length > 0) {
    var badgesData = JSON.parse(badges[1]);
    return badgesData.length;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}

/**
To use this code, you will need to copy and paste it into a new Google Apps Script project. Then, you will need to replace the following values:
The name of the spreadsheet that contains the list of links to Cloud Skills Boost public profiles
The name of the sheet in the spreadsheet that contains the list of links
The range of cells in the spreadsheet that contains the number of badges for each profile
Once you have replaced the values, you can save the code and run it. The code will access the Google Sheet, review the list of links to Cloud Skills Boost public profiles, review each profile, and calculate the number of badges. The number of badges for each profile will be written to the spreadsheet.
