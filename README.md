Hi! Some of the tutorials and code walkthroughs are available via our youtube channel** https://www.youtube.com/@askaraituov**

# Appscript and GenAI tutorials
**Lesson 1**
**The task.**
You should review an appscript code below. The app should do the following. It should access Google sheets. Review the list of links which lead to open cloudskillsboost public profiles. Review each profile and calculate number of badges. Here is an example of a cloudskillsboost public profile. https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/85a2f4b6-ce2a-4a67-a362-675c4a366772. Here is an example of a badge https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/85a2f4b6-ce2a-4a67-a362-675c4a366772/badges/4776948

Please consider the code below and review if it's launchable. You can fork this code or alternatively you can create your own code. Regards, Askar
